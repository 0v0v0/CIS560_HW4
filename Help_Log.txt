HW4 Scene Graph v1.0

/////////////////////


In this program, I added cube.h and cube.cpp into the scene folder. These two files defined a cube. 

I mainly modified the mygl.h and mygl.cpp. 

A new class called SceneGraph is added, which defined a node in the SceneGraph. 


In this homework, I tried to make a centaur, or something looks like that. 

You can see what it looks like if you're not familiar with it. 

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centaur


My scene graph starts from the horse body of the centaur, since it is the biggest part. 

Since I failed to make a QTree, I will show the node structure here. 


ROOT: 			     Horse Body
			 /        \      \      \     \
Child: 		       Human Body, leg1, leg2, leg3, leg4
		  /       |    \
SubChild:	Head,   arm1,   arm2


If you like it, you can modify the shapes in the MyGL::initializeGL() in mygl.cpp


In addition, to test the shading, I made the centaur running during the time using a rotate( sin(time) );

I wish it won't scare you when running.

Troubles: 

1-Where's the messege loop in QT? I can not find it, and it's not comfortable for me, since there's a messege loop in MFC. 

2-I used the Intel Graphic Card and the Nvidia Graphic Card to render. I noticed there's some difference. I have put the screenshot in this folder. I wonder if that's my fault or the hardware's fault.
